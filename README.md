Binary Search Tree
===================

By QuintonJ

A basic implementation of a binary search tree. Includes the use of ordering, adding, removing, and others.

Building / Compiling / Deployment
-----------------------------

- BST: the "main" class that implements the binary search tree.
- BSTInterface: the interface that the tree will implement.
- BSTNode: represents a Node object which contains data in addition to having a left and right node.

Future Improvements
-----------------------------

- Cleaning up the remove method.

Credits
-----------------------------
- BSTInterface and BSTNode were written by TAs within the class. BST was created through the implementation of the given classes.
